//! MLS Wire Protocol (Phase 2 of MLS rollout).
//!
//! This module is the wire-format source of truth for the MLS layer
//! described in `misc/specs/MLS.md` §3. It carries:
//!
//! 1. The application-layer **envelope** wrappers
//!    ([`MlsEnvelopeP`] / [`MlsApplicationEnvelopeP`] /
//!    [`WelcomeEnvelopeP`]) that promote `DispatchP::payload` from a
//!    static-shared-key ciphertext to a postcard-encoded MLS frame
//!    (§3.1).
//! 2. The **KeyPackage distribution** RPCs
//!    ([`KeyPackagePublishReq`], [`KeyPackageFetchReq`],
//!    [`KeyPackageRefillReq`] and their outcome enums) plus the stored
//!    [`KeyPackageRecord`] form the home relays use to vend
//!    one-time KeyPackages (§3.4 – §3.6, §5).
//! 3. **Signing-input helpers** that domain-separate every signed
//!    transcript (`MLS_DOMAIN_*` tags) and reproduce the §3 layouts
//!    byte-for-byte.
//!
//! ## What is *not* in this module
//!
//! - **No MLS bytes are serialised here.** Wherever the spec says
//!   "TLS-encoded openmls value" we carry it verbatim as a
//!   [`ByteVec`] field; the producer is openmls's own `tls_codec`,
//!   not our codec. This is load-bearing for the layered design — we
//!   may rewrite *our* envelope wire format without touching the MLS
//!   internals, and vice-versa.
//! - **No client logic.** Nothing in here decides who sends what; it
//!   only fixes the wire grammar. Phase 3 owns the client-side
//!   composition.
//!
//! ## Bump considerations
//!
//! `MLS.md` §0 calls for `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 3` once MLS ships
//! network-wide. **That bump is Phase 4's responsibility.** For Phase
//! 2 we keep the global `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2` constant unchanged
//! (mixed pre-MLS and MLS code paths must keep verifying old packets)
//! and use the [`MLS_WIRE_VERSION`] constant as the version field
//! mixed into MLS-specific transcripts. Phase 4 will reconcile the
//! two by either:
//!   - bumping `PROTOCOL_VERSION` to 3 and changing every signing
//!     helper here to read it instead of `MLS_WIRE_VERSION`, or
//!   - keeping `MLS_WIRE_VERSION` as the dedicated MLS version field
//!     forever.
//!
//! Either way the v3 marker survives in the on-wire transcripts so a
//! future v3 endpoint refuses to verify a v2-style signature even if
//! the byte layout happens to match (mirrors the
//! [`crate::PROTOCOL_VERSION`] discipline elsewhere).
//!
//! ## Signing transcript layout
//!
//! Every helper mirrors the layout pioneered in `dht_p2p.rs`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   <MLS_DOMAIN_*> || protocol_version (BE u16) || <fields in declaration order>
//! ```
//!
//! Each transcript has its own unique domain string so a captured
//! signature for one packet kind cannot be replayed as another.
//!
//! design-doc: `misc/specs/MLS.md` §3 (wire protocol), §5 (KeyPackage
//! distribution), §13.9 (per-fan-out signature reuse hardening).
