 * present, else the local ULID — so edit / delete / reaction / receipt, which all
 * mutate the same row in place, surface as updates to the *same* list item rather
 * than churn. Built from libcore's MessageRecord joined with its reactions. Every
 * field is value-equality-friendly (no raw ByteArray) so LazyColumn diffing is
 * correct; the 16-byte dispatch id rides as hex and converts at the FFI boundary.
