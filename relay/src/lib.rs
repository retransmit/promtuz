//! Relay library surface — re-exports of the crate's modules so other
//! crates' integration tests (notably `libcore/tests/e2e_phase5b.rs`)
//! can drive `Dht::new`, the `peer/1` handler, and the column-family
//! descriptors directly.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The relay is primarily a binary (see `bin/main.rs` and `main.rs`).
//! For Phase 5b's e2e tests we need to spin up real `Dht` instances
//! inside a test harness, which requires the crate to also be linkable
//! as a library. Visibility on individual modules stays `pub(crate)`
//! by default — only what the e2e harness consumes is bumped to `pub`,
//! and that's documented in the modules themselves.
//!
//! No new code lives in this file. Behaviour changes happen in the
//! underlying modules (`dht`, `quic`, etc.); this is purely a façade.
//!
//! design-doc: `misc/specs/MLS.md` §11.3d (Phase 5b harness pattern).
