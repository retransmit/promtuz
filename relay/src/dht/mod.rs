//! Relay-side user-presence DHT.
//!
//! Top-level [`Dht`] struct wires the sub-systems together; the actual
//! routing-table / store / lookup / sync / publish logic lives in
//! sibling modules. Sub-lock layout follows §9.3 of the design doc.
//!
//! Phase 1a (this commit) ships the *shape* — module tree, struct
//! fields, public APIs, RocksDB column-family creation. Method bodies on
//! routing/lookup/store/etc. are stubbed so subsequent phases (1b–1h)
//! can drop in implementations without touching the wiring again.
//!
//! design-doc: `misc/specs/DHT.md`. Sections most relevant to this file:
//! §0 (constants), §1.2 (CFs), §1.3 (routing-table state), §9.1 (module
//! tree), §9.3 (Relay-struct sub-lock layout), §10 (Phase 1 = ship
//! feature-flagged off).

// Phase 1a is intentionally skeletal: the module tree, type signatures,
// and CF wiring exist but most bodies are `unimplemented!()`. Subsequent
// phases (1b–1h) populate them. Suppress dead-code warnings until those
// land — they're expected, and the noise drowns out real warnings.
