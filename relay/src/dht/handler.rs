//! Inbound `peer/1` connection dispatcher.
//!
//! Replaces the old `relay/src/quic/handler/peer.rs` no-op stub with a
//! single funnel into the DHT's RPC handlers. One QUIC connection ⇒ one
//! task spawned in `handle_peer_connection`; that task waits for an
//! application-layer signed handshake, then accepts bi-streams in a
//! loop and dispatches each to a per-RPC handler.
//!
//! ## Signed `DhtHello` first, then RPCs
//!
//! Before any RPC is accepted, the dialer must send a [`DhtHello`]
//! (Ed25519-signed transcript binding `node_id` to `pubkey` and a
//! fresh timestamp) on the **first uni-stream** of the connection.
//! The receiver:
//!
//! 1. Awaits `accept_uni()` with a 5-second timeout (
//!    [`HELLO_RECV_TIMEOUT`]). A peer that connects but never sends a
//!    hello gets dropped — see [`HELLO_RECV_TIMEOUT`] doc-comment for
//!    the rationale on the value.
//! 2. Decodes via `DhtHello::unpack` and validates with
//!    `DhtHello::verify(now_ms())` — same checks the resolver does for
//!    `RelayHello` (id-binding, signature, ±60s skew window).
//! 3. On any failure, closes with the appropriate `CloseReason::Dht*`
//!    and bumps `metrics.dht_hello_rejected`. On success, the
//!    authenticated `NodeId` is bound to the connection for its full
//!    lifetime.
//!
//! Authenticated identity then **replaces** the synthetic-stable_id
//! and `[0u8; 32]` placeholders that would otherwise be needed because
//! the TLS server config uses `with_no_client_auth()` (clients also
//! reuse the same endpoint, so we can't enable mTLS without splitting
//! the endpoint — see `relay/src/dht/tls_extract.rs` for that gap).
//!
//! ## Per-stream dispatch
//!
//! Every DHT RPC is one bi-stream: open_bi → write request → finish()
//! send → read response → done. The acceptor side mirrors that:
//! accept_bi → read request → write response → finish.
//!
//! ## Concurrency cap
//!
//! Per-peer concurrent in-flight RPC streams are capped via a
//! `tokio::sync::Semaphore` (the same idiom as `client/mod.rs`'s
//! 16-stream limiter). Per-RPC-kind rate limits harden this further.
//!
//! ## Routing-table feedback
//!
//! Every successful inbound RPC is observable as a "this peer is
//! alive" signal — we touch the routing table by calling
//! `RoutingTable::insert` with the dialer's authenticated NodeId,
//! `addr`, and verified pubkey. The pubkey comes from the verified
//! `DhtHello` (`BLAKE3(pubkey) == node_id` was checked at hello time),
//! not a `[0u8; 32]` placeholder.
//!
//! ## Per-peer rate limiting
//!
//! Every inbound RPC is also passed through the per-peer keyed rate
//! limiter on `Dht::rate_limiters` before being dispatched. The limiter
//! key is the authenticated `NodeId` for *every* inbound RPC, including
//! the ones that don't carry an in-payload `requester` field (Ping,
//! Store, Tombstone, MerkleSummary, MerkleDiff, FetchRecord). A
//! reconnecting attacker therefore can't reset their quota — the NodeId
//! is identity-bound.
//! Tripping the limiter closes the whole connection with
//! `CloseReason::DhtFlood` (and bumps `metrics.rate_limit_rejections`).
//!
