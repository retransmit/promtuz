//! Recipient-side K-closest queue-fetch fan-out (sticky-home).
//!
//! When a user reconnects to a relay R_r that is **not** in the user's
//! K-closest set by XOR distance, R_r cannot serve the queue locally
//! — the homes hold the queued offline messages. R_r dials the K homes
//! over `peer/1`, issues `QueueFetch` against each, pages through the
//! response stream, and aggregates the dispatches before handing them to
//! the regular client-drain protocol in
//! `quic/handler/client/events/drain.rs`.
//!
//! This module is the sister to [`super::forward::forward_to_homes`]
//! and deliberately mirrors its shape — same `JoinSet`-driven
//! parallel-RPC loop, same deadline-bounded budget, same per-peer
//! best-effort tally (a single home's failure is non-fatal).
//!
//! ## Fetch / deletion split
//!
//! [`fetch_remote_queues`] does *fetch + deliver only*. The matching
//! `QueueFetchAck` (which proves the user received specific dispatch
//! IDs and lets the home delete them) is driven separately by
//! [`ack_remote_queues`], because `QueueFetchAck`'s transcript signs
//! `delivered_ids` — a list only knowable *after* fetching has
//! happened. The signing input has to be assembled on the recipient
//! relay and then handed to libcore for a per-batch user signature.
//!
//! **Consequence**: until the ack round runs, queued copies linger at
//! the home until natural TTL expiry (~10 min), so duplicate delivery
//! is possible if the user reconnects multiple times within that
//! window. The client must dedupe by [`DispatchP::id`]; this module
//! also dedupes cross-home replicas by `id` before returning so the
//! down-stream drain count is honest.
//!
//! ## Lock contract
//!
//! `parking_lot::RwLock<RoutingTable>` is read once to compute the
//! K-closest descriptors; we clone descriptors out of the guard
//! before any `await` (project-wide rule, cf. `forward.rs:59`).

///
/// 1. Compute the K-closest by XOR distance to `NodeId::from_bytes(*user_ipk)`.
/// 2. Filter out `self_relay_id` (the local cf-iter path is the right
///    callsite for self's own queue, not this module).
/// 3. If the filtered set is empty, return `Err(NoHomes)`.
/// 4. For each home in parallel ([`tokio::task::JoinSet`]):
///    (a) Open / reuse a `peer/1` connection via
///    `lookup::connect_to_peer`.
///    (b) Send `QueueFetch { user_ipk, requester_relay_id =
///    self_relay_id, timestamp = drain_auth.timestamp, user_sig =
///    drain_auth.sig }`.
///    (c) Read `QueueFetchResp { messages, exhausted }`.
///    (d) While `exhausted == false`, page (same auth — the transcript
///    doesn't bind page index, so the home reuses the same
///    freshness check). Up to [`MAX_QUEUE_FETCH_PAGES`] pages.
/// 5. Concat all dispatches and deduplicate by `DispatchP.id` so a
///    cross-home replicated message arrives at the client exactly
///    once. Order within `id`-duplicates is "first home in the
///    fan-out wins" — the homes' iterators are themselves ordered by
///    `MessageKey` (recipient || ts_be || dispatch_id), so the
///    dedupe is stable across reconnects.
/// 6. Total wall-clock bound: [`QUEUE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`].
///
/// **Important**: this function does **not** send `QueueFetchAck` to
/// any home — the deletion path is driven separately by
/// [`ack_remote_queues`] (it requires per-batch user signing in
/// libcore). Until the ack round runs, the home keeps its
/// `cf_dht_queue` entries until natural TTL expiry — which means the
/// same dispatch can arrive on the next reconnect. The client dedupes
/// by `DispatchP.id` (and so does this function for the cross-home
/// case).
///
/// **Caller's contract**: the recipient drain handler in
/// `quic/handler/client/events/drain.rs` snaps `ctx.drain_auth` out
/// of the mutex (no lock across `await`), checks
/// `i_am_home == false`, and calls this. On `Err(_)`, the handler
/// falls through to a local-only drain so a transient DHT/network
/// hiccup doesn't lose visibility on whatever messages exist on this
/// relay's own `cf_dht_queue` (e.g. recently-arrived stale-K queue).

/// Sends a `QueueFetchAck` to each home in `homes` in parallel,
/// bounded by [`QUEUE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`] total wall-clock. Best-
/// effort: failures are logged and counted but **not** propagated —
/// a queue-not-deleted at one home means duplicate delivery on the
/// next reconnect, which the client already dedupes by id.
///
/// **`requester_relay_id`**: the wire ack binds this relay's NodeId
/// into the user-signed transcript. Each home rejects
/// the ack at the handler if its connection's authenticated peer id
/// doesn't equal `dht.node_id` (i.e. each home only honours acks
/// arriving on its connection from *this* relay). One signature
/// still serves all K homes — the binding is to "the relay the user
/// authenticated to," not to a specific home identity.
///
/// **Empty-`delivered_ids` short-circuit**: if the union is empty
/// (no homes contributed messages), we still send the ack so the
/// homes' rate-limiters log the ack RPC. Caller can also choose to
/// skip the call entirely; both are correct.
