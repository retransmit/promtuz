//! Sender-side K-closest dispatch fan-out (sticky-home phase 2b).
//!
//! When a relay receives a `Dispatch` from a connected client and the
//! recipient is **not** online locally, the spec
//! (`misc/specs/STICKY_HOME_RELAY.md` §4.2) routes the dispatch to the K
//! "home" relays: the K relays whose NodeIds are closest by XOR to the
//! recipient's `user_ipk`. Each home either delivers locally (recipient
//! online there) or queues the dispatch in `cf_dht_queue` for later
//! pickup.
//!
//! This module implements that fan-out from the *sender* side. It is the
//! sister to [`super::publish::publish`] and deliberately mirrors its
//! shape — same `K_MIN`-quorum success criterion, same `JoinSet`-based
//! parallel dispatch, same self-store short-circuit when the sender
//! relay is itself in the K-closest set.
//!
//! ## Why a separate module instead of merging into `publish.rs`
//!
//! The two paths share the *structure* (parallel RPCs, K_MIN quorum,
//! self-store shortcut) but diverge meaningfully:
//!
//! - `publish` operates on `PresenceRecord` and writes to `cf_presence`;
//!   `forward_to_homes` operates on `DispatchP` and writes to
//!   `cf_dht_queue`.
//! - `publish` returns a single typed outcome enum
//!   (`StoreOutcome::Stored` etc.); `forward_to_homes` distinguishes
//!   `Delivered` from `Stored` because the sender uses that to decide
//!   between [`DispatchAckP::Delivered`] and [`DispatchAckP::Forwarded`]
//!   on the originating client's ack.
//! - `publish` carries an Ed25519-signed presence record; `Forward`
//!   carries an unmodified `DispatchP` plus an *additional* outer
//!   sender-relay signature (the two-layer signing model in §5.1).
//!
//! Sharing the dispatch-parallel idiom with a generic helper would have
//! cost more in indirection than the ~40 lines of duplicated `JoinSet`
//! plumbing, so they live as siblings.
//!
//! ## Lock contract
//!
//! Same as the rest of `dht/`: `parking_lot` guards are never held
//! across `await`. `dht.routing.read().find_closest(...)` is the only
//! routing-table read; we clone descriptors out and release the lock
//! before any I/O.
//!
//! design-doc: `misc/specs/STICKY_HOME_RELAY.md` §4.2 (sender-side flow),
//! §5.1 (`Forward` wire shape), §6.1 (`cf_dht_queue`), §7 question 1
//! (`K_MIN = 2`), §7 question 4 (sender-relay-is-K-closest shortcut).
