//! Cold-start bootstrap: ask the resolver for seed peers, dial them,
//! seed the routing table, run self-FindNode for forced convergence.
//!
//! Phase 1a stubbed the entry point; phase 1c (this commit) lands the
//! resolver-side `GetBootstrapPeers` RPC and the first half of the §3.5
//! state machine — phases A (resolver query) and B (insert into routing
//! table). Phases C (self-FindNode for forced convergence) and the
//! periodic re-ask scheduler land in later sub-phases (1e, 1g) once the
//! lookup module exists.
//!
//! ## Failure semantics
//!
//! Bootstrap failure is **not fatal**. The relay keeps serving QUIC
//! traffic even with an empty routing table — DHT RPCs simply have no
//! peers to forward to until the next bootstrap attempt succeeds. The
//! caller is expected to log [`BootstrapError`] and either retry on a
//! schedule (phase 1g) or accept the empty-routing-table state.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! The whole machine takes only `Arc<Dht>` and a [`ResolverLinkHandle`]
//! — no `&Relay` reference — so it's safe to drive from a detached
//! `tokio::spawn` task. `parking_lot` guards on `dht.routing` are
//! never held across an `await`: we batch the inserts into a single
//! write-guard scope after the resolver round-trip has fully completed.
//!
//! design-doc: §3.5 (fresh-relay bootstrap state machine), §9.4
//! (resolver `GetBootstrapPeers` RPC).
