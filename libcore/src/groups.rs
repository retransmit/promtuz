//! Group membership — creating a group, adding, removing, leaving.
//!
//! Every membership change is one MLS Commit that has to reach *every existing
//! member*, plus a Welcome for anyone joining. Both ride the ordinary
//! Application envelope: openmls self-describes what an inner message is, and
//! the receive path already routes a `StagedCommitMessage` into
//! `merge_staged_commit`. That is why no new wire variant appears here.
//!
//! The ordering rule throughout: **fan the Commit out before merging it
//! locally**. Merge first and a failed fan-out leaves us an epoch ahead of
//! everyone, able to encrypt messages nobody can read.
//!
//! Authority (v1): the creator is the sole admin and may add or remove; any
//! member may leave. That is a policy check here, not a protocol rule, so
//! loosening it later needs no wire change.
