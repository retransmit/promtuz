//! Process-global state singletons.
//!
//! Extracted from `quic::server` so consumers that need the global
//! `RELAY` (e.g. `messaging::sendMessage`, which reads it for the
//! per-connection `RelayDhtClient` dialer) can do so without forming
//! an intra-crate cycle:
//!
//! ```text
//!   messaging  ─┐
//!                    ├─→  state::RELAY
//!   quic::server   ──┘
//! ```
//!
//! Previously both modules referred to each other through the global
//! sitting in `quic::server`, which the `cycle-detector` flagged as a
//! load-bearing intra-crate cycle. Moving the global to a leaf module
//! breaks the cycle without changing the runtime behaviour: `quic::server`
//! still owns the `Relay` value's lifetime; `state::RELAY` is just the
//! shared box.
