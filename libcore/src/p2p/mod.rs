//! The relay stays the fallback (and the signaling path — candidates
//! ride the existing MLS channel), but bulk/live traffic goes straight
//! device-to-device once a hole is open. Built bottom-up: the poke wire

// Submodules land as the stack is built; each is exercised by the layer
// above it, so the compiler can't see all users until the top is wired.
