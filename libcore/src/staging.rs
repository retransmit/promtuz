//! Composer staging: media sitting in the buffer before it becomes a message.
//!
//! Picking a photo used to *be* the send. Staging splits that in two:
//! [`stage_image`] / [`stage_attachment`] return an id immediately and run the
//! expensive pass (AVIF compress, BLAKE3 manifest) off-thread, so it overlaps
//! with the caption still being typed; [`commit`] turns the ready items into
//! messages once the user actually sends.
//!
//! The registry is in memory: a staged item is exactly as transient as the text
//! draft beside it, and holding it here keeps un-sent media out of `messages`
//! entirely — no draft can leak into history, a conversation preview, or the
//! pending-send retry sweep. An attachment's manifest is the exception and
//! lives on in the transfer store, so the costly hash survives even when the
//! staging entry doesn't.
//!
//! State changes ring the [`crate::platform::CoreEvents::on_db_changed`]
//! doorbell under `"staging"`, so the client re-reads through the same reactive
//! path it uses for every other table.
