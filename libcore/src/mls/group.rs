//! `MlsGroupHandle` — high-level wrapper over `openmls::group::MlsGroup`
//! exposing the promtuz-flavored group API.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! - **Lifecycle**: create / add / remove / self-update / leave.
//! - **Application messaging**: encrypt-out, decrypt-in (inner MLS
//!   message wrapping; outer envelope is in `welcome.rs` and the
//!   `messaging.rs` wiring).
//! - **Export secret** for SFrame integration.
//!
//! # Cipher suite pin
//!
//! Hard-pinned to
//! `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519` (suite
//! `0x0003`). Note that openmls 0.8's
//! `MlsGroupCreateConfig::default()` selects a *different* suite
//! (`MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519`) — we override at
//! construction time. **Mismatch on this would silently shift the
//! AEAD from ChaCha20-Poly1305 to AES-128-GCM, breaking the spec.**
//! Pinned in [`PROMTUZ_CIPHERSUITE`].
//!
//! # Group ID shape
//!
//! `group_id` is fixed at 32 B. `openmls::group::GroupId`
//! accepts arbitrary length; we constrain at construction by passing
//! `&[u8; 32]` and convert via `GroupId::from_slice`.
//!
//! # Signer caveats
//!
//! `openmls_traits::signatures::Signer` is intentionally narrow: it
//! exposes `sign(&self, payload) -> Vec<u8>` and `signature_scheme`
//! only — **no public-key getter**. Therefore [`Self::create`] takes
//! the leaf signing public key as an explicit argument; the caller is
//! responsible for keeping it consistent with the signer's secret
//! half. Both [`super::signer::Ed25519Signer::public_key`] and
//! `openmls_basic_credential::SignatureKeyPair::public()` expose the
//! 32-byte slice the constructor wants.

// All public items here are consumed by `messaging.rs`; the cdylib
// compiler can't see across the JNI boundary so it flags them as
// dead. Module-wide allow-lint matches the pattern in `provider.rs`.
