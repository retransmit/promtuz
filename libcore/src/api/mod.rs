//! FFI translation layer.
//!
//! A leaf: it depends on the core engine (`messaging`, `data`, `mls`,
//! `quic`, `state`, …) and nothing depends on it. uniffi is the glue —
//! this module only translates between the native core and clients.
//!
//! Rebuilt from scratch in the manual-JNI → uniffi migration (#3). The
//! old hand-rolled JNI surface is archived at
//! `../.archive/libcore-jni-api/` for reference while this is filled in.
