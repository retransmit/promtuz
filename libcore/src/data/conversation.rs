//! Conversations — the chat scope every message, reaction, receipt and media
//! row hangs off.
//!
//! A conversation is identified by a locally-minted 16-byte id that never
//! changes, and points at the MLS group currently backing it. The pointer is
//! deliberately *not* the identity: three paths re-mint a group id under a live
//! conversation — the send path recreating a group whose local state went
//! missing, [`heal_dead_group`] re-establishing after a restore, and an inbound
//! Welcome adopting the peer's group on a re-pair. History keyed on the group
//! id would be orphaned by each of them.
//!
//! A 1:1 chat is the degenerate case: `kind = DIRECT`, two members. One code
//! path serves 1 and N.
